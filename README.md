# Sorting Algorithms in Ruby

## Insertion Sort

Insertion Sort is a very simple and common sense approach to the sorting problem. It is stable, in-place, online, and efficient for small data sets and data sets that are already mostly sorted.

## Merge Sort

Merge Sort is a divide and conquer algorithm for sorting which is generally stable. Its average and worst case performance is O(n log n), which makes it more efficient than Insertion for most sets.

## Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is an extremely simple and generally poor-performing algorithm for sorting which iterates through a list and swaps values that are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the list is fully sorted. It has a worst-case and average complexity of O(n^2).

## Bogosort

Bogosort is an intentionally inefficient algorithm for sorting which randomly shuffles the list until it is correctly sorted. It is not seriously used for any purpose but rather is interesting only in comparison to more efficient algorithms.
