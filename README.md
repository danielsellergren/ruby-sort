# Sorting Algorithms in Ruby

## Insertion Sort

Insertion is a very simple and common sense approach to the sorting problem. It is stable, in-place, online, and efficient for small data sets and data sets that are already mostly sorted.

## Merge Sort

Merge is a divide and conquer algorithm for sorting which is generally stable. Its average and worst case performance is O(n log n), which makes it more efficient than Insertion for most sets.
